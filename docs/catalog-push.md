# Catalog Push Action

This action allows you to add an application to the Napptive Catalog.

## Napptive Catalog

The Napptive catalog is a collection of applications ready to be deployed. All users of the [Napptive Playground](https://playground.napptive.dev) have at their disposal the applications contained in the catalog.

The applications within the catalog are organized in different namespaces. You can upload apps to your accountâ€™s namespace. The application will be named as per the following notation: namespace/appName:tag.

To list all the available applications, execute:


```bash
$ playground login
Logged into account [account] - environment [environment]

$ playground catalog list
...
```
